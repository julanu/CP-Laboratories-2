	Description: Using a recursive function, calculate the sum of a series composed of keyboard entered
				values. The values are read as long as the user desires so. Modify the function in order to
				determine and display the average value of the entered numbers. Print on the screen a
				significant message when the sum is greater than a predefined value.
